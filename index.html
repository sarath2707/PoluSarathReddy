            <p class="date">July-2022 to November-2022</p>
            <p class="description">Together with other technologies like GitHub, ArgoCD, Docker Trusted Registry, and UCD, I oversaw supporting and updating the OpenShift tool in versions 3.* and 4.*. This required integrating GitHub, OpenShift, and DTR as well as executing upgrade and patching tasks in the OpenShift platform's DEV, QA, and Prod environments. In addition, I managed the Microsoft Azure tool and had duties with a Linux server</p>

            <p class="date">November-2019 to July-2020</p>
            <p class="description">A Jenkins CI/CD procedure was implemented to make it easier to establish a Gatekeeper Step. To properly integrate the Pull Request life cycle, declarative scripts for the Jenkins pipeline were also created. The group also assumed responsibility for Linux server tasks. Escalation protocols for all Severity 1/2/3 tickets were maintained, along with daily, weekly, and monthly availability and SLA Violation Reports. It was made sure that change orders were opened correctly, promptly, and with the appropriate level of severity. The group contributed technical assistance while taking part in scheduled activities and implementations</p>
