        <h2>About</h2>
        <p class="about_text">As a DevOps Engineer, I have 5 years of experience in releasing product updates, spotting production issues, and integrating with Redhat Openshift, Azure, and AWS. Implementing secure computing, storage, and network services, as well as constructing and maintaining Openshift clusters with DTR and ArgoCD, are among my specialties. I'm an expert in managing source code with Git/GitHub, AWS CloudWatch, and creating custom metrics. Cost optimisation, IAM, posture management, and incident management are all aspects of my real-world experience.</p>
